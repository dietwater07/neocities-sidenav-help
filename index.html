                <h2>Greetings Fellow Websurfers!</h2>
                <p>I am Diet Water, or you can call me Sam, and this is my own personal website! I am still currently trying to learn html and css, and maybe some javascript in the future. This is a place where I'll express myself freely with no restrictions. Have fun on my site!</p>

                <h2>Site Updates</h2>
                <p><span class="color">11.22.2023 </span>Wrote another opinion on polynomial division. I'll change some things in the nav menu and make subjects not all clumped together on one page so you're not scrolling forever. On Thanksgiving break right now so it's nice. I think I'll read a book, watch the "John Adams" miniseries I bought, and listen to some new albums. It's looking to be pretty chill.</p>
                <p><span class="color">11.18.2023 </span>Wrote my first "opinion" piece in the writing section. Thinking of doing another site redesign to give it a bit more personality. Still the same template, but more colors, gifs, whatnot.</p>
                <p><span class="color">11.16.2023 </span>Haven't updated this website in 2 weeks. Sorry about that, I have been busy lately with school and personal things, you know. Guess I'll rate some mroe albums?</p>
                <p><span class="color">10.18.2023 </span>Created a google form today! Please take it. It's on the "form" section of this website.</p>
                <p><span class="color">10.12.2023 </span>Did my first album review today, <a href="albums/mhtrtc.html">Music Has the Right to Children</a>. Also wrote a little more personal blog entry. Might delete later but who knows.</p>
                <p><span class="color">10.10.2023 </span>Finished albums. Will put reviews of them soon. Wrote first book review in writing section. I also saw that I now have two followers! Thanks! I hope you enjoy my site as much as I do! :&#41;</p>
                <p><span class="color">10.07.2023 </span>Put more albums on music page. Once I'm done, I'll start reviewing some of them. I probably won't get to all of them for a while though. As I've been doing this, I've been listening to <a class="visible" href="https://youtu.be/6z-RSH4altM?si=ZRUs_Mlr21zISPyU">Boards of Canada - Old Tunes Vol. 2 (Remastered)</a> by NAHT 87. I didn't know boc invented liminal space music???</p>
                <p><span class="color">10.05.2023 </span>Edited the writing section to include a blog. Wrote first entry. Will continue to work on music section.</p>
                <p><span class="color">09.30.2023 </span>Added the rest of the planned subpages. I haven't updated this website in a bit because of school and I've been starting to feel like shit.</p>
                <p><span class="color">08.21.2023 </span>Added under construction gif and fixed colors. Made it looks more "professional" (it's isn't at all)</p>
                <p><span class="color">08.20.2023 </span>Made it so links go to left side of page! Really proud of how much I know now. I'm feeling pretty confident about this :)</p>
                <p><span class="color">08.19.2023 </span>New Site Redesign Started! Currently listening to New Order - Movement</p>
